                            you have provided to us, in order to provide my

                            not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of

                            compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean

                            You should be aware that there are certain things that
                            Kirlos Yousef will not take responsibility for. Certain
                            functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                            internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                            by your mobile network provider, but Kirlos Yousef
                            cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                            functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                            have any of your data allowance left.

                            mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                            be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                            the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                            other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                            responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                            charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                            (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                            you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                            using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                            received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

                            responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                            make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                            battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,

                            use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                            bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                            updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                            to provide information to us so that we can make it available

                            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                            currently available on iOS – the requirements for

                            using the app. Kirlos Yousef does not promise that it
                            will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
